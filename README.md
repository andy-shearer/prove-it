# Hobbyist NFTs
(Project names are all currently placeholders)

## 🧶 Hobbyist NFTs released under an innovative minting process
The set has traits based off certain activities/hobbies/sports, launched in multiple 'series' releases. An NFT is only mintable by providing proof that you're interested or competent in the activity/area of that NFT.

For example, if a series was related to sports there might be traits related to surfing or tennis. In order for a person to mint the surfing NFT, they need to upload 'proof' that they can surf or play tennis.

A community voting model can review the proof and decides who mints.

## 🪙 Fair minting
Current problems with minting:
* Making people grind in Discord for a whitelist spot is rubbish
* Favours those with large amounts of crypto
* Can sell out in seconds
* Successful projects can come out of nowhere, with secondary market sales 'pricing out' a lot of people without 💵💵💵

Including real-world requirements in the minting process is an innovative way to address a few of those main issues mentioned above.
Minting isn't a race anymore, and isn't going to solely favour those with huge amounts of ETH.

## ⚖️ 'Proof' & Voting
Users have to 'prove' they should be allowed to mint - the proof needs to be sufficient to convince the community moderation to allow the mint.
The level of moderation that the community voting system enforces is completely controlled by the community.   

Restricting who can mint as described above, adds exclusivity to the ownership of the tokens. Each series could have a strong secondary market if the project gains popularity.
