# Hobbyist NFTs
Project names are all currently placeholders.

## Hobbyist NFTs released under an innovative minting process
The set has traits based off certain activities/hobbies/sports, launched in multiple 'series' releases. An NFT is only mintable by providing proof that you're interested or competent in the activity/area of that NFT.

For example, if a series was related to sports there might be traits related to surfing or tennis. In order for a person to mint the surfing NFT, they need to upload 'proof' that they can surf or play tennis.

A community voting model reviews the proof and decides who mints.

## Fair minting
Current problems with minting:
* Favours those with large amounts of crypto
* Can sell out in seconds - tough luck if you didn't make it
*  
It isn't a race, and it isn't going to favour anyone with huge amounts of ETH.
